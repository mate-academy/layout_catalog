# Catalog transitions
- Create a new branch (for example `smooth-changes`) in your [catalog solution](readme.md)
- When ready make a Pull Request from your new branch to your `develop` branch.
  - Pull Request should show only the changes you made during this task and nothing more.

## Task
- Make all the changes smooth on hover (All links and buttons).
- Smoothly (during 400ms) increase the catalog__card image by 20 percent on image hover.
- (*) Add 3px border to the image when hovering.
  - Border should be the same color as the catalog__card border.
  - It should appear immediately.
  - The picture should not "jump".
- (*) Add padding so the top left and right borders of the image match the outer borders of the catalog__card.
